# Windows Shell

- In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. 
- In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. 
- It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
---
- Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).
---
- Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. 
- Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells. 
---
- Windows Shell is simple shell that provides API for creating, viewing, manipulating and finding files and directories in the File System.
- It provides user-friendly API and easy navigation.
